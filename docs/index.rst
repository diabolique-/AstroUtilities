Welcome to Sinistra's documentation!
==========================================

Sinistra is a Python library of functions I've found useful in my time
doing astronomy. They may or may not be useful to anyone else. 

The name Sinistra comes from the name of the astronomy professor at Hogwarts 
in the Harry Potter universe, Professor Sinistra.
